# MinimumFinder

Hi! This is a small Java program I created for a programming assignment. The goal was to write a program that reads a list of numbers and displays the smallest one.

The logic is simple: the user enters how many numbers they want to input, then types those numbers, and the program finds the smallest among them. I wrote everything in English as requested for the course, and tried to keep the code clean and easy to understand.

## How it works

The program first asks for an integer `N`, which represents how many numbers will be entered. Then it reads those `N` numbers and compares them one by one to find the smallest value.

### Example input:
5 200 100 3000 656 98  
### Output:
98

## How to run it

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the folder where the file is saved.  
2. Compile the Java file:  javac MinimumFinder.java
3.  Run the program: java MinimumFinder
4.  4. Enter your input when prompted. First the number of values, then the values themselves.

## Files included

- `MinimumFinder.java`: the source code I wrote.  
- `MinimumFinder.class`: the compiled version (automatically generated after compilation).
